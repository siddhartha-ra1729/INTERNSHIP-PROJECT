I am currently completing a 2-month online training and internship from Ardent, focused on Deep Learning using CNN and Keras. Throughout this internship, I have gained hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies, including TensorFlow, while working on an eye-disease classification project. This project has sharpened my ability to build and optimize convolutional neural networks for real-world medical image classification tasks. Additionally, I am deepening my knowledge of essential deep learning concepts like transfer learning, data augmentation, and model evaluation. This internship has enhanced my technical skills in Python, machine learning algorithms, and the broader applications of artificial intelligence in solving complex problems.
